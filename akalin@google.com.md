Hello, 

I'm trying to build the draft 06 of http2 on Chromuim, but i can't get the source code of Chromuim. 
I'm using Windows 7. I followed all the steps listed in the instructions mainly getting depot-tools, installing gclient, but when i'm trying to make the fetch the source code (since i'm not belonging to chromium committers, i can't get it using svn) i'm having this error  : 

fatal : unable to access 'https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromuim/src.git/' : Failed connect to chromuim.googlesource.com:443; No error 

Can you please help me? 
best regards,
