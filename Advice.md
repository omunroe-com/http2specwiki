* The spec notes that [stream ids must be increasing](http://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#StreamIdentifiers), but this can be easy to accidentally violate. If after frame generation, you insert the frame into a priority queue, then it's possible for a higher priority frame to move ahead. Therefore, stream ids must be generated/committed later in processing in order to ensure correct stream id ordering.
